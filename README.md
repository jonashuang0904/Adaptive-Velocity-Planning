# Adaptive Velocity Planning in Autonomous Racing
In order to present better performance of handling of limit, we develop the Data-driven Gaussian Processes (GP) to make the friction estimation between tire and ground. 
## Summary
I would like to present you an adaptive velocity planning I developed with my teammate Thore at KA-RaceIng for the autonomous electric vehicle, the KIT24.

## Highlight and demo
The adaptive frip estimation is able to be acheived by the gaussian process.

## Description
KA-RaceIng is a racing team of students from *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology* competing in *Formula Student*.
*Formula Student* is an international engineering competition. 50-member teams from universities around the world design, build, and code autonomous electric full-sized race cars.

KA-RaceIng is one of the world's best formula student teams in autonomous racing.
- 1st place of Engineering Design Driverless in Formula Student Germany 2024
- 2nd place in Formula Student East 2024 (driverless) and broke two competetion records for SkidPad and Acceleration.
- 2nd place in Formula Student Germany 2023 (driverless)
- 1st place in Formula Student Hungary 2022 (driverless)
- 1st place in Formula Student Germany, Hungary, and Czech 2021 (driverless)
## License
The code I wrote in this project is private. The KA-RaceIng team actively uses it. It is the core of motion planning at KA-RaceIng and contributes its part to our success in autonomous racing. Hence, I cannot publish any of this code here. I can give you more insights in a personal discussion, though.
